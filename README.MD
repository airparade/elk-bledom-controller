# ELK-BLEDOM Controller

This project is inspired by [TheSylex's ELK-BLEDOM-bluetooth-led-strip-controller](https://github.com/TheSylex/ELK-BLEDOM-bluetooth-led-strip-controller).  The original project provides a way to control ELK-BLEDOM LED strips via Bluetooth.

As a Rust beginner, I found it challenging to directly use the existing project. Therefore, I decided to create a similar implementation in Rust to better understand the underlying concepts and gain practical experience with the language.
